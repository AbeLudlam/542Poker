#This is a mock demonstration to show how to automatically test user input for our program. The way the program currently works, makes this not feasible because of the loops, so this is a mock demonstration for a program that requires a single user input. One assumption that must be made for this code to be considered valid is that there is a function called input_Getter(parameter "prompt=''") in the main file for this single user input.

#def fake_input():
#   with mock.patch('poker.input_Getter') as m:
#       yield m


#def test_my_great_func(fake_input):
#    fake_input.return_value = '1'
#    assert use_eval() assertion (use_eval is also not properly set up for tests)
