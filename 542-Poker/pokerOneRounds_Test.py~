#Function: This test set shows a stubbed out one_round5() so that its logic flow can be automatically tested. This is more of a demonstration of a stubbed out test set than a compelete test set. The complete test set would have stubbed out versions of one_round7 and one_round73, with 3 test cases for the former and 7 for the latter. We decided against doing this as the logic flow graphs already show their logic flow and the tests themselves are somewhat redundant.
